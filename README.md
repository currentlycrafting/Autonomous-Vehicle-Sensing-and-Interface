# Real-Time Vision-Based Occupancy Mapping for Autonomous Navigation Using Low-Cost Multi-Camera Systems

---

## Overview

This project explores how **low-cost, vision-only autonomous systems** can achieve **human-trustworthy spatial awareness** using real-time **multi-camera input** and machine learning. We aim to build a **self-navigating model vehicle** that uses camera data to generate **Bird's Eye View (BEV) occupancy maps**, enabling it to identify free space and obstacles for autonomous navigation.

This system offers an alternative to expensive LiDAR/radar setups by relying solely on camera input, making it suitable for scalable, cost-effective autonomous platforms.

## Objectives

* Build a prototype autonomous vehicle powered by **three mounted cameras** (front, left, right).
* Train a **lightweight CNN model** to detect occupancy (free vs. obstructed space) from stereo images.
* Generate **real-time BEV occupancy maps** using depth approximation and semantic segmentation.
* Visualize live heatmaps on a local dashboard for transparency and interpretability.

# Abstract
This research investigates how low-cost, vision-only autonomous systems can achieve human-trustworthy spatial awareness using real-time multi-camera input and machine learning. The project aims to build a self-navigating, camera-powered model vehicle capable of detecting free space and obstacles using a simplified Bird's Eye View (BEV) occupancy map derived from stereo vision and a trained spatial segmentation model. This system addresses the growing demand for safer and more transparent camera-based navigation methods in customer-facing autonomous technologies.

The methodology includes mounting three cameras (front, left, and right) on a mobile vehicle chassis, capturing labeled driving scene images across a controlled test course, and training a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to generate occupancy maps from those views. Depth will be approximated using stereo image pairs, and resulting BEV maps will be visualized as live-updating heatmaps on a local dashboard. A rule-based controller will interpret the BEV maps to initiate movement or stopping decisions in real time.

Preliminary tests on simulated data demonstrate effective detection of occupied versus navigable zones. The expected outcome is a functioning proof-of-concept that links spatial vision modeling with real-world action. Future work will explore improved fusion methods and confidence-aware learning.

# Introduction / Background
As the demand for consumer-facing autonomous systems increases, ensuring safety, spatial awareness, and user trust remains a critical challenge. Most modern autonomous vehicles rely on expensive LiDAR and radar sensors, but vision-based systems offer a scalable, lower-cost alternative. This research explores the feasibility of using only cameras and lightweight machine learning to map obstacles and free space in real-time, enabling autonomous vehicles to make navigation decisions similarly to a human driver.

Tesla’s camera-only approach to autonomy has sparked industry-wide discussion about the limits and potential of spatial modeling using vision alone. This project aims to investigate whether a low-cost, embedded system can interpret space effectively from multiple camera views and perform real-time navigation using learned occupancy mapping — with transparency, responsiveness, and safety at its core.

Research Question & Hypothesis

# Hypothesis
A lightweight multi-view convolutional neural network can be trained to produce accurate occupancy predictions from front and side camera feeds, allowing a robotic vehicle to autonomously navigate through a controlled space while reacting to obstacles in real time.

Project Phases



# Phase 1: Camera Integration & Calibration (Weeks 1–2)
Mount and align cameras on the vehicle.
Calibrate intrinsics + extrinsics using OpenCV.
Test stereo vision depth estimation.

# Phase 2: Dataset Collection (Week 2–3)
Build a taped indoor course with fixed obstacles.
Drive vehicle manually and record synchronized image sets.
Use simple labeling to assign “occupied” vs “free” zones in grid maps.

# Phase 3: Model Training (Week 4)
Train a lightweight CNN to map 3-view images to a 2D BEV occupancy grid.
Use BCE loss with synthetic labels; augment with simulated images from CARLA if needed.

# Phase 4: Inference + Heatmap Display (Week 5–6)
Run trained model on Jetson/Pi.
Generate live BEV occupancy map → visualize with heatmap overlay.
If occupied region ahead, send “stop” signal via GPIO; else move forward.

# Phase 5: Evaluation + Logging (Week 6) 
Test model in various lighting and obstacle setups.
Log predictions, overlay maps, and failure cases.
Evaluate precision, recall, and inference time.
Expected Results
We expect the final system to:

Display live BEV heatmaps on a local dashboard.
Successfully stop or turn when obstacles appear within predicted danger zones.
Operate entirely from camera input with no need for LiDAR or GPS.
Impact and Broader Significance
This project contributes to the growing field of vision-based spatial ML by demonstrating that real-time perception and safe movement are achievable without expensive hardware. Its impact lies in making autonomous systems more accessible, explainable, and trustworthy for general use — from micro-mobility and delivery robots to assistive devices and smart infrastructure. The live visual output also addresses a key trust issue in autonomy: understanding what the system sees and why it acts.




# Intellectual Merit / Scientific Contribution
This research provides:

A working pipeline for low-cost BEV map prediction from multi-camera vision.
An efficient, interpretable system linking ML predictions to real-world control.
Insights into using stereo and monocular cues for simplified 3D reasoning.
The design, testing, and evaluation of the system can support future academic work in robotics, human-machine interaction, and autonomous vehicle safety.

# Contingency Plan
If real-time inference on Jetson or Pi is too slow, fallback options include:

# Offloading inference to a connected laptop via Wi-Fi.
Simplifying the model architecture for faster inference.
Using a rule-based OpenCV solution as a backup to test movement loop.
All system components are modular, ensuring flexibility in deployment and testing.

# Outcome
The outcome will be a low-cost autonomous vehicle that interprets its surroundings via multiple camera feeds, generates BEV heatmaps, and makes safe decisions in real time. All code, documentation, and findings will be published to a GitHub repository. Depending on results, a future paper or workshop poster presentation may follow.
